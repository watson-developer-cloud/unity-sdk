## Deprecation Notice
This repo and its associated release binaries are being deprecated. While this repo will no longer see active support from the IBM team, contributions by the community via PRs are still welcomed and will be reviewed. Keep in mind, updates will no longer be published into release binaries and changes made after this update will need to be compiled independently.

Use this SDK to build Watson-powered applications in Unity.

## Announcements
### Tone Analyzer Deprecation
As of this major release, 6.0.0, the Tone Analyzer API has been removed in preparation for deprecation. If you wish to continue using this sdk to make calls to Tone Analyzer until its final deprecation, you will have to use a previous version.
On 24 February 2022, IBM announced the deprecation of the Tone Analyzer service. The service will no longer be available as of 24 February 2023. As of 24 February 2022, you will not be able to create new instances. Existing instances will be supported until 24 February 2023.

As an alternative, we encourage you to consider migrating to the Natural Language Understanding service on IBM Cloud. With Natural Language Understanding, tone analysis is done by using a pre-built classifications model, which provides an easy way to detect language tones in written text. For more information, see [Migrating from Watson Tone Analyzer Customer Engagement endpoint to Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-tone_analytics).

### Natural Language Classifier Deprecation
As of this major release, 6.0.0, the NLC API has been removed in preparation for deprecation. If you wish to continue using this sdk to make calls to NLC until its final deprecation, you will have to use a previous version.
On 9 August 2021, IBM announced the deprecation of the Natural Language Classifier service. The service will no longer be available from 8 August 2022. As of 9 September 2021, you will not be able to create new instances. Existing instances will be supported until 8 August 2022. Any instance that still exists on that date will be deleted.

As an alternative, we encourage you to consider migrating to the Natural Language Understanding service on IBM Cloud that uses deep learning to extract data and insights from text such as keywords, categories, sentiment, emotion, and syntax, along with advanced multi-label text classification capabilities, to provide even richer insights for your business or industry. For more information, see [Migrating to Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-classifier?topic=natural-language-classifier-migrating).

### Updating endpoint URLs from watsonplatform.net
Watson API endpoint URLs at watsonplatform.net are changing and will not work after 26 May 2021. Update your calls to use the newer endpoint URLs. For more information, see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson?topic=watson-endpoint-change.

## Before you begin
Ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* You need an [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud-onboarding] account.
* [Unity][get_unity]. You can use the **free** Personal edition.

## Configuring Unity
* Change the build settings in Unity (**File > Build Settings**) to any platform except for web player/Web GL. The IBM Watson SDK for Unity does not support Unity Web Player.
* If using Unity 2018.2 or later you'll need to set **Scripting Runtime Version** and **Api Compatibility Level** in Build Settings to **.NET 4.x equivalent**. We need to access security options to enable TLS 1.2. 

> Updating MacOS to Mojave may disable microphone for Unity. If you are running into this issue please see these [guidelines](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209175) to configure microphone for Mojave. 


## Getting the Watson SDK and adding it to Unity
You can get the latest SDK release by clicking [here][latest_release_sdk]. **You will also need to download the latest release of the IBM Unity SDK Core by clicking [here][latest_release_core].**

### Installing the SDK source into your Unity project
Move the **`unity-sdk`** and **`unity-sdk-core`** directories into the **`Assets`** directory of your Unity project. _Optional: rename the SDK directory from `unity-sdk` to `Watson` and the Core directory from `unity-sdk-core` to `IBMSdkCore`_.

## Configuring your service credentials
To create instances of Watson services and their credentials, follow the steps below.

**Note:** Service credentials are different from your IBM Cloud account username and password.

1. Determine which services to configure.
1. If you have configured the services already, complete the following steps. Otherwise, go to step 3.
    1. Log in to IBM Cloud at https://cloud.ibm.com.
    1. Click the service you would like to use.
    1. Click **Service credentials**.
    1. Click **View credentials** to access your credentials.
1. If you need to configure the services that you want to use, complete the following steps.
    1. Log in to IBM Cloud at https://cloud.ibm.com.
    1. Click the **Create service** button.
    1. Under **Watson**, select which service you would like to create an instance of and click that service.
    1. Give the service and credential a name. Select a plan and click the **Create** button on the bottom.
    4. Click **Service Credentials**.
    5. Click **View credentials** to access your credentials.
1. Your service credentials can be used to instantiate Watson Services within your application. Most services also support tokens which you can instantiate the service with as well.

The credentials for each service contain either a `username`, `password` and endpoint `url` **or** an `apikey` and endpoint `url`.

**WARNING:** You are responsible for securing your own credentials. Any user with your service credentials can access your service instances!

## Authentication
Watson services are migrating to token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.

- With some service instances, you authenticate to the API by using **[IAM](#iam)**.
- In other instances, you authenticate by providing the **[username and password](#username-and-password)** for the service instance.

### Getting credentials
To find out which authentication to use, view the service credentials. You find the service credentials for authentication the same way for all Watson services:

1.  Go to the IBM Cloud **[Dashboard][watson-dashboard]** page.
1.  Either click an existing Watson service instance or click **Create**.
1.  Click **Show** to view your service credentials.
1.  Copy the `url` and either `apikey` or `username` and `password`.

In your code, you can use these values in the service constructor or with a method call after instantiating your service.

### IAM

Some services use token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. IAM authentication uses a service API key to get an access token that is passed with the call. Access tokens are valid for approximately one hour and must be regenerated.

You supply either an IAM service **API key** or an **access token**:

- Use the API key to have the SDK manage the lifecycle of the access token. The SDK requests an access token, ensures that the access token is valid, and refreshes it if necessary.
- Use the access token if you want to manage the lifecycle yourself. For details, see [Authenticating with IAM tokens](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson?topic=watson-iam). If you want to switch to API key, in a coroutine, override your stored IAM credentials with an IAM API key and yield until the credentials object `HasIamTokenData()` returns `true`.

#### Supplying the IAM API key
```cs
Authenticator authenticator;
AssistantService assistant;
string versionDate = "<service-version-date>";

IEnumerator TokenExample()
{
    //  Create authenticator using the IAM token options
    authenticator = new IamAuthenticator(apikey: "<iam-api-key>");
    while (!authenticator.CanAuthenticate())
        yield return null;

    assistant = new AssistantService(versionDate, authenticator);
    assistant.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");
    assistant.ListWorkspaces(callback: OnListWorkspaces);
}

private void OnListWorkspaces(DetailedResponse<WorkspaceCollection> response, IBMError error)
{
    Log.Debug("OnListWorkspaces()", "Response: {0}", response.Response);
}
```

#### Supplying the access token
```cs
Authenticator authenticator;
AssistantService assistant;
string versionDate = "<service-version-date>";

void TokenExample()
{
    //  Create authenticator using the Bearer Token
    authenticator = new BearerTokenAuthenticator("<bearer-token>");

    assistant = new AssistantService(versionDate, authenticator);
    assistant.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");
    assistant.ListWorkspaces(callback: OnListWorkspaces);
}

private void OnListWorkspaces(DetailedResponse<WorkspaceCollection> response, IBMError error)
{
    Log.Debug("OnListWorkspaces()", "Response: {0}", response.Response);
}
```

### Username and password
```cs
Authenticator authenticator;
AssistantService assistant;
string versionDate = "<service-version-date>";

void UsernamePasswordExample()
{
    Authenticator authenticator = new BasicAuthenticator("<username>", "<password>", "<url>");
    assistant = new AssistantService(versionDate, authenticator);
    assistant.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");
}
```

### Supplying authenticator

There are two ways to supply the authenticator you found above to the SDK for authentication.

#### Credential file (easier!)

With a credential file, you just need to put the file in the right place and the SDK will do the work of parsing it and authenticating. You can get this file by clicking the **Download** button for the credentials in the **Manage** tab of your service instance.

The file downloaded will be called `ibm-credentials.env`. This is the name the SDK will search for and **must** be preserved unless you want to configure the file path (more on that later). The SDK will look for your `ibm-credentials.env` file in the following places (in order):

- Your system's home directory
- The top-level directory of the project you're using the SDK in

As long as you set that up correctly, you don't have to worry about setting any authentication options in your code. So, for example, if you created and downloaded the credential file for your Discovery instance, you just need to do the following:

```cs
public IEnumerator ExampleAutoService()
{
    Assistant assistantService = new Assistant("2019-04-03");

    //  Wait for authorization token
    while (!assistantService.Authenticator.CanAuthenticate())
        yield return null;

    var listWorkspacesResult = assistantService.ListWorkspaces();
}
```

And that's it!

If you're using more than one service at a time in your code and get two different `ibm-credentials.env` files, just put the contents together in one `ibm-credentials.env` file and the SDK will handle assigning authenticator to their appropriate services.

If you would like to configure the location/name of your credential file, you can set an environment variable called `IBM_CREDENTIALS_FILE`. **This will take precedence over the locations specified above.** Here's how you can do that:

```bash
export IBM_CREDENTIALS_FILE="<path>"
```

where `<path>` is something like `/home/user/Downloads/<file_name>.env`.

#### Manually

If you'd prefer to set authentication values manually in your code, the SDK supports that as well. The way you'll do this depends on what type of authenticator your service instance gives you.

## Callbacks
A success callback is required. You can specify the return type in the callback.
```cs
AssistantService assistant;
string assistantVersionDate = "<assistant-version-date>";
Authenticator assistantAuthenticator;
string workspaceId = "<workspaceId>";

DiscoveryService discovery;
string discoveryVersionDate = "<discovery-version-date>";
Authenticator discoveryAuthenticator;

private void Example()
{
    assistant = new AssistantService(assistantVersionDate, assistantAuthenticator);
    assistant.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");

    discovery = new DiscoveryService(discoveryVersionDate, discoveryAuthenticator);
    discovery.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");

    //  Call with sepcific callbacks
    assistant.Message(
        callback: OnMessage,
        workspaceId: workspaceId
    );

    discovery.ListEnvironments(
        callback: OnGetEnvironments
    );
}

private void OnMessage(DetailedResponse<MessageResponse> response, IBMError error)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnMessage()", "Response received: {0}", response.Response);
}

private void OnGetEnvironments(DetailedResponse<ListEnvironmentsResponse> response, IBMError error)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnGetEnvironments()", "Response received: {0}", response.Response);
}
```

Since the success callback signature is generic and the failure callback always has the same signature, you can use a single set of callbacks to handle multiple calls.
```cs
AssistantService assistant;
string assistantVersionDate = "<assistant-version-date>";
Authenticator assistantAuthenticator;
string workspaceId = "<workspaceId>";

DiscoveryService discovery;
string discoveryVersionDate = "<discovery-version-date>";
Authenticator discoveryAuthenticator;

private void Example()
{
    assistant = new AssistantService(assistantVersionDate, assistantAuthenticator);
    assistant.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");

    //  Call with generic callbacks
    JObject input = new JObject();
    input.Add("text", "");
    assistant.Message(
        callback: OnSuccess,
        workspaceId: workspaceId,
        input: input
    );

    discovery = new DiscoveryService(discoveryVersionDate, discoveryAuthenticator);
    discovery.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");

    discovery.ListEnvironments(
        callback: OnSuccess
    );
}

//  Generic success callback
private void OnSuccess<T>(DetailedResponse<T> resp, IBMError error)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnSuccess()", "Response received: {0}", resp.Response);
}
```

You can also use an anonymous callback
```cs
AssistantService assistant;
string assistantVersionDate = "<assistant-version-date>";
Authenticator assistantAuthenticator;
string workspaceId = "<workspaceId>";

private void Example()
{
    assistant = new AssistantService(assistantVersionDate, assistantAuthenticator);

    assistant.ListWorkspaces(
        callback: (DetailedResponse<WorkspaceCollection> response, IBMError error) =>
        {
            Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnSuccess()", "ListWorkspaces result: {0}", response.Response);
        },
        pageLimit: 1,
        includeCount: true,
        sort: "-name",
        includeAudit: true
    );
    assistant.SetServiceUrl("<service-url>");
}
```

You can check the `error` response to see if there was an error in the call.
```cs
AssistantService assistant;
string assistantVersionDate = "<assistant-version-date>";
Authenticator assistantAuthenticator;
string workspaceId = "<workspaceId>";

private void Example()
{
    assistant = new AssistantService(versionDate, authenticator);

    assistant.Message(OnMessage, workspaceId);
}

private void OnMessage(DetailedResponse<MessageResponse> response, IBMError error)
{
    if (error == null)
    {
        Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnMessage()", "Response received: {0}", response.Response);
    }
    else
    {
        Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnMessage()", "Error received: {0}, {1}, {3}", error.StatusCode, error.ErrorMessage, error.Response);
    }
}
```

## Custom Request Headers
You can send custom request headers by adding them to the service.

```cs
AssistantService assistant;
string assistantVersionDate = "<assistant-version-date>";
Authenticator assistantAuthenticator;
string workspaceId = "<workspaceId>";

void Example()
{
    assistant = new AssistantService(assistantVersionDate, assistantAuthenticator);

    //  Add custom header to the REST call
    assistant.WithHeader("X-Watson-Metadata", "customer_id=some-assistant-customer-id");
    assistant.Message(OnSuccess, "<workspace-id>");
}

private void OnSuccess(DetailedResponse<MessageResponse> response, IBMError error)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnMessage()", "Response received: {0}", response.Response);
}
```

## Response Headers
You can get response headers in the `headers` object in the DetailedResponse.

```cs
AssistantService assistant;
string assistantVersionDate = "<assistant-version-date>";
Authenticator assistantAuthenticator;
string workspaceId = "<workspaceId>";

void Example()
{
    assistant = new AssistantService(assistantVersionDate, assistantAuthenticator);

    assistant.Message(OnMessage, "<workspace-id>");
}

private void OnMessage(DetailedResponse<MessageResponse> response, IBMError error)
{
    //  List all headers in the response headers object
    foreach (KeyValuePair<string, object> kvp in response.Headers)
    {
        Log.Debug("ExampleCustomHeader.OnMessage()", "{0}: {1}", kvp.Key, kvp.Value);
    }
}
```

## Transaction IDs
Every SDK call returns a response with a transaction ID in the `X-Global-Transaction-Id` header. Together the service instance region, this ID helps support teams troubleshoot issues from relevant logs.

```cs
public void ExampleGetTransactionId()
{
    AssistantService service = new AssistantService("{version-date}");
    service.ListWorkspaces(
        callback: (DetailedResponse<Workspace> response, IBMError error) =>
        {
            if(error != null)
            {
                Log.Debug("AssistantServiceV1", "Transaction Id: {0}", error.ResponseHeaders["X-Global-Transaction-Id"]);
            }
            else
            {
                Log.Debug("AssistantServiceV1", "Transaction Id: {0}", response.Headers["X-Global-Transaction-Id"]);
            }
        }
    );
}
```

However, the transaction ID isn't available when the API doesn't return a response for some reason. In that case, you can set your own transaction ID in the request. For example, replace `<my-unique-transaction-id>` in the following example with a unique transaction ID.

```cs
public void ExampleSetTransactionId()
{
    AssistantService service = new AssistantService("{version-date}");
    service.WithHeader("X-Global-Transaction-Id", "<my-unique-transaction-id>");
    service.ListWorkspaces(
        callback: (DetailedResponse<Workspace> response, IBMError error) =>
        {
            if(error != null)
            {
                Log.Debug("AssistantServiceV1", "Transaction Id: {0}", error.ResponseHeaders["X-Global-Transaction-Id"]);
            }
            else
            {
                Log.Debug("AssistantServiceV1", "Transaction Id: {0}", response.Headers["X-Global-Transaction-Id"]);
            }
        }
    );
}
```

## TLS 1.0 support
Watson services have upgraded their hosts to TLS 1.2. The Dallas location has a TLS 1.0 endpoint that works for streaming. To stream in other regions, use Unity 2018.2 and set **Scripting Runtime Version** in Build Settings to `.NET 4.x equivalent`. To support Speech to Text in earlier versions of Unity, create the instance in the Dallas location.

## Disabling SSL verification
You can disable SSL verifciation when making a service call.
```cs
AssistantService assistant;
string assistantVersionDate = "<assistant-version-date>";
Authenticator assistantAuthenticator;
string workspaceId = "<workspaceId>";

void Example()
{
    authenticator.DisableSslVerification = true;
    assistant = new AssistantService(assistantVersionDate, assistantAuthenticator);

    //  disable ssl verification
    assistant.DisableSslVerification = true;
}
```

## IBM Cloud Pak for Data(ICP4D)
If your service instance is of ICP4D, below are two ways of initializing the assistant service.

#### 1) Supplying the `username`, `password`, `icp4d_url` and `authentication_type`

The SDK will manage the token for the user

```cs
    CloudPakForDataAuthenticator authenticator = new CloudPakForDataAuthenticator("<url>", "<username>", "<password>");
    while(!authenticator.CanAuthenticate())
    {
        yield return null;
    }
    service = new AssistantService(versionDate, authenticator);
```

#### 2) Supplying the access token

```cs
    BearerTokenAuthenticator = new BearerTokenAuthenticator("<accessToken>");
    while(!authenticator.CanAuthenticate())
    {
        yield return null;
    }
    service = new AssistantService(versionDate, authenticator);
```

## IBM Cloud Private
The Watson Unity SDK does not support IBM Cloud Private because connection via proxy is not supported in UnityWebRequest. 

## Documentation
Documentation can be found [here][documentation]. You can also access the documentation by selecting API Reference the Watson menu (**Watson -> API Reference**).
