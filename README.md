## Before you begin
Ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* An IBM Cloud account. If you don't have one, [sign up][ibm_cloud_registration].
* [Unity][get_unity]. You can use the **free** Personal edition.
* Change the build settings in Unity (**File > Build Settings**) to any platform except for web player/Web GL. The Watson Developer Cloud Unity SDK does not support Unity Web Player.

## Getting the Watson SDK and adding it to Unity
You can get the latest SDK release by clicking [here][latest_release].

### Installing the SDK source into your Unity project
Move the **`unity-sdk`** directory into the **`Assets`** directory of your Unity project. _Optional: rename the SDK directory from `unity-sdk` to `Watson`_.

## Configuring your service credentials
To create instances of Watson services and their credentials, follow the steps below.

**Note:** Service credentials are different from your IBM Cloud account username and password.

1. Determine which services to configure.
1. If you have configured the services already, complete the following steps. Otherwise, go to step 3.
    1. Log in to IBM Cloud at https://console.bluemix.net.
    1. Click the service you would like to use.
    1. Click **Service credentials**.
    1. Click **View credentials** to access your credentials.
1. If you need to configure the services that you want to use, complete the following steps.
    1. Log in to IBM Cloud at https://console.bluemix.net.
    1. Click the **Create service** button.
    1. Under **Watson**, select which service you would like to create an instance of and click that service.
    1. Give the service and credential a name. Select a plan and click the **Create** button on the bottom.
    4. Click **Service Credentials**.
    5. Click **View credentials** to access your credentials.
1. Your service credentials can be used to instantiate Watson Services within your application. Most services also support tokens which you can instantiate the service with as well.

The credentials for each service contain either a `username`, `password` and endpoint `url` **or** an `apikey` and endpoint `url`.

**WARNING:** You are responsible for securing your own credentials. Any user with your service credentials can access your service instances!

## Watson Services

* [Visual Recognition](/Scripts/Services/VisualRecognition/v3)

## Authentication
Before you can use a service, it must be authenticated with the service instance's `username`, `password` and `url`.

```cs
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Services.Assistant.v1;
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Utilities;

void Start()
{
    Credentials credentials = new Credentials(<username>, <password>, <url>);
    Assistant _assistant = new Assistant(credentials);
}
```

For services that authenticate using an apikey, you can instantiate the service instance using a `Credential` object with an `apikey` and `url`.

```cs
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Services.VisualRecognition.v3;
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Utilities;

void Start()
{
    Credentials credentials = new Credentials(<apikey>, <url>);
    VisualRecognition _visualRecognition = new VisualRecognition(credentials);
}
```

## Callbacks
Success and failure callbacks are required. You can specify the return type in the callback.  
```cs
private void Example()
{
    //  Call with sepcific callbacks
    assistant.Message(OnMessage, OnGetEnvironmentsFail, _workspaceId, "");
    discovery.GetEnvironments(OnGetEnvironments, OnFail);
}

//  OnMessage callback
private void OnMessage(object resp, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnMessage()", "Response received: {0}", customData["json"].ToString());
}

//  OnGetEnvironments callback
private void OnGetEnvironments(GetEnvironmentsResponse resp, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnGetEnvironments()", "Response received: {0}", customData["json"].ToString());
}

//  OnMessageFail callback
private void OnMessageFail(RESTConnector.Error error, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Error("ExampleCallback.OnMessageFail()", "Error received: {0}", error.ToString());
}

//  OnGetEnvironmentsFail callback
private void OnGetEnvironmentsFail(RESTConnector.Error error, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Error("ExampleCallback.OnGetEnvironmentsFail()", "Error received: {0}", error.ToString());
}
```

Since the success callback signature is generic and the failure callback always has the same signature, you can use a single set of callbacks to handle multiple calls.
```cs
private void Example()
{
    //  Call with generic callbacks
    assistant.Message(OnSuccess, OnMessageFail, "<workspace-id>", "");
    discovery.GetEnvironments(OnSuccess, OnFail);
}

//  Generic success callback
private void OnSuccess<T>(T resp, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCallback.OnSuccess()", "Response received: {0}", customData["json"].ToString());
}

//  Generic fail callback
private void OnFail(RESTConnector.Error error, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Error("ExampleCallback.OnFail()", "Error received: {0}", error.ToString());
}
```

## Custom data
Custom data can be passed through a `Dictionary<string, object> customData` in each call. In most cases, the raw json response is returned in the customData under `"json"` entry. In cases where there is no returned json, the entry will contain the success and http response code of the call.

```cs
void Example()
{
    Dictionary<string, object> customData = new Dictionary<string, object>();
    customData.Add("foo", "bar");
    assistant.Message(OnSuccess, OnFail, "<workspace-id>", "", customData);
}

//  Generic success callback
private void OnSuccess<T>(T resp, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Debug("ExampleCustomData.OnSuccess()", "Custom Data: {0}", customData["foo"].ToString());  // returns "bar"
}

//  Generic fail callback
private void OnFail(RESTConnector.Error error, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    Log.Error("ExampleCustomData.OnFail()", "Error received: {0}", error.ToString());  // returns error string
    Log.Debug("ExampleCustomData.OnFail()", "Custom Data: {0}", customData["foo"].ToString());  // returns "bar"
}
```

## Custom Request Headers
You can send custom request headers by adding them to the `customData` object.

```cs
void Example()
{
    //  Create customData object
    Dictionary<string, object> customData = new Dictionary<string, object>();
    //  Create a dictionary of custom headers
    Dictionary<string, string> customHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    //  Add to the header dictionary
    customHeaders.Add("X-Watson-Metadata", "customer_id=some-assistant-customer-id");
    //  Add the header dictionary to the custom data object
    customData.Add(Constants.String.CUSTOM_REQUEST_HEADERS, customHeaders);

    assistant.Message(OnSuccess, OnFail, "<workspace-id>", customData: customData);
}
```

## Response Headers
You can get responseheaders in the `customData` object in the callback.

```cs
void Example()
{
    assistant.Message(OnMessage, OnFail, "<workspace-id>");
}

private void OnMessage(object resp, Dictionary<string, object> customData)
{
    //  List all headers in the response headers object
    if (customData.ContainsKey(Constants.String.RESPONSE_HEADERS))
    {
        foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> kvp in customData[Constants.String.RESPONSE_HEADERS] as Dictionary<string, string>)
        {
            Log.Debug("ExampleCustomHeader.OnMessage()", "{0}: {1}", kvp.Key, kvp.Value);
        }
    }
}
```

## Authentication Tokens
You use tokens to write applications that make authenticated requests to IBM Watsonâ„¢ services without embedding service credentials in every call.

You can write an authentication proxy in IBM Cloud that obtains and returns a token to your client application, which can then use the token to call the service directly. This proxy eliminates the need to channel all service requests through an intermediate server-side application, which is otherwise necessary to avoid exposing your service credentials from your client application.

```cs
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Services.Assistant.v1;
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Utilities;

void Start()
{
    Credentials credentials = new Credentials(<service-url>)
    {
        AuthenticationToken = <authentication-token>
    };
    Assistant _assistant = new Assistant(credentials);
}
```

There is a helper class included to obtain tokens from within your Unity application.

```cs
using IBM.Watson.DeveloperCloud.Utilities;

AuthenticationToken _authenticationToken;

void Start()
{
    if (!Utility.GetToken(OnGetToken, <service-url>, <service-username>, <service-password>))
        Log.Debug("ExampleGetToken.Start()", "Failed to get token.");
}

private void OnGetToken(AuthenticationToken authenticationToken, string customData)
{
    _authenticationToken = authenticationToken;
    Log.Debug("ExampleGetToken.OnGetToken()", "created: {0} | time to expiration: {1} minutes | token: {2}", _authenticationToken.Created, _authenticationToken.TimeUntilExpiration, _authenticationToken.Token);
}
```
